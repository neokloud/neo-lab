**Context**
- You are working in a Kubernetes cluster with an existing Deployment named `busybox-logger` running in a namespace called `priority`.  
The cluster already has at least one user-defined PriorityClass.
---
# Task
Perform the following tasks:
1. **Create a new PriorityClass** named `high-priority` for user workloads.  
   - The value of this PriorityClass should be exactly **one less** than the highest existing user-defined PriorityClass value.
2. **Patch the existing Deployment** `busybox-logger` in the `priority` namespace to use the newly created `high-priority` PriorityClass.  
   - Ensure the Deployment **rolls out successfully**.
---
# Note
- Pods from other Deployments in the namespace may be **evicted automatically** if resource contention occurs due to the higher priority of `busybox-logger`.  
- Manual eviction is **not required** unless explicitly instructed.
