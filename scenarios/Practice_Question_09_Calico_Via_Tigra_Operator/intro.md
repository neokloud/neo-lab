# Configure CNI with Native NetworkPolicy Support

You are working on a Kubernetes cluster that currently has **no Container Network Interface (CNI)** installed.

The cluster must support **native Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`** resources.

Two CNI options are available:

* `Flannel v0.26.1`
  `https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/download/v0.26.1/kube-flannel.yml`

* `Calico v3.28.2`
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.2/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml`

## Requirements

* Select the CNI plugin that provides native Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` support.
* Install the selected CNI in the cluster.
* Ensure all CNI components are running successfully after installation.
* Verify that cluster networking becomes operational.
