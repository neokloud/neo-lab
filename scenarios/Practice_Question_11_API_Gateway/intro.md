You have an existing web application deployed in a Kubernetes cluster using an Ingress resource named web. You must migrate the existing Ingress configuration to the new Kubernetes Gateway API, maintaining the existing HTTPS access configuration.

Tasks:
Create a Gateway resource named web-gateway with hostname gateway.web.k8s.local that maintains the existing TLS and listener configuration from the existing Ingress resource named web.

Create an HTTPRoute resource named web-route with hostname gateway.web.k8s.local that maintains the existing routing rules from the current Ingress resource named web.

Note: A GatewayClass named nginx is already installed in the cluster.
